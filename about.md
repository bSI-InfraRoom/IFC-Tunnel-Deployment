# IFC-for-Tunneling Deployment programme

## Goal

The main goal of the *IFC-for-Tunneling Deployment programme* is to refine, validate and implement
 the IFC for Tunneling Draft Standard (issued August 2022) so to make it
 a bSI Candidate Standard before it is submitted into the ISO publication process.


## Target Audience

The programme is primarily targeted at providers of:

- professional design or construction management software, 
- collaborative BIM platforms, 
- BIM Viewers/Checkers, 
- customed solutions, 
- SDK packages, 
- machine guidance solutions, 
- assets management solutions, and/or 
- integration services, 

that are addressing the needs of the underground infrastructures industry.


## Background

The IFC for Tunneling Draft Standard was developed during 2020-2022 by bSI's IFC-for-Tunnelling Team 
 (made of more than 55+ geotechnicians, excavation experts, systems operators from all over the world) 
 and expands upon the IFC4.3 standard (released August 2021).
It covers the following disciplines:

- geotechnical situations and their uncertainties,
- mechanized and traditional excavation processes, lining technics, support and reinforcement measures,
- systems incl. ventilation, lightning, drainage & dewatering, safety & evacuation, HV/LV.


## Approach

As part of this Deployment programme we have prepared a set of activities, tools and IFC expertise so to provide you
 with the solid technical support you need to efficiently implement bSI's IFC-for-Tunnelling (IFC for Tunneling) concepts, including:

- guidance to best understand the IFC for Tunneling *HTML documentation* (objects/properties), and the IFC for Tunneling *Express schema extensions*,
- royalty-free domain-specific datasets for testing purposes,
- unit tests (concepts usages, aka how to exploit the concepts) through a 3-level approach:
    - Level 1 : concept 'project' usages (all IfcProject usages),
    - Level 2 : concept 'sub-project' usages (types, spatial-or-linear structures, groupings),
    - Level 3 : concept 'entity' usages (geometry, material, classification, ownerships),
- shared GitHub platform with quality/consistency checking, and
- examples of code and IFC for Tunneling files.


## Timeplan

Timing-wise, the IFC-for-Tunnelling (IFC for Tunneling) Deployment programme
 is organized to last from January till June 2023.
The work is divided into sprints, with each sprint roughly lasting 4 weeks
 (start – implement/submit – QA/check – fix – deliver) - an overall plan is found [here](./project_plan.pdf).

During these sprints, we offer 2 support sessions per week (to best accomodate timezones),
 to pick up from as need be:
- every Thursday 8am CET and
- every Thursday 6pm CET.


## Reporting

We intend to report upon the progress of the programme through the bSI website/blog as well as
 through the [International Tunnelling Association (ITA)](www.ita-aites.org) and its national branches.


## Participation

The participation is free-of-charge, but we expect a minimum commitment in terms of resources
 so to properly endorse the programme.
