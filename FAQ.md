# FAQ

## Where to start?

**Our software is *exporting* IFC datasets. Where should I start?**

Please read through the sprint documentation [here](https://github.com/bSI-InfraRoom/IFC-Tunnel-Deployment/tree/main/sprints). We recommend going from top to bottom and implement exporting functionality as indicated by *Usages* section in each sprint documentation.

When happy with the export, you are welcome to open a pull request and get your file automatically checked as well as reviewed by the project team.

**Our software is *importing* IFC datasets. Where should I start?**

Please use any (preferably all) of the files provided [here](https://github.com/bSI-InfraRoom/IFC-Tunnel-Deployment/tree/main/files). 

Please denote successful import by providing a screen shot in the same folder as the originating dataset resides. Other kind of proof is welcome as well.

We recommend starting/appending to a readme named after your software in each directory. You are free in the structure of the readme (as of now).

## Review

**The check is failing. Where is the report?**

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59165496/214881281-2f428c31-2de1-48f3-8564-2a7b27fe4174.png "In the Action tab, click on *Summary*.")

**I get the following message in review**

- *lftm*

Looks fine to me. This means the reviewer did not spot any obvious mistakes.

- *The file has a lot more content than required - this approval only covers the concepts as part of Sprint x.y and its prerequisites. It may be that the file will fail future checks and will need amendment.*

The file exceeds the requirements from Sprint x.y. While the submitted file has been approved, this does not constitute any approval for content outside the Sprint x.y's scope.
