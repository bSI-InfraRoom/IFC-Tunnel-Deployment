# FAQ

## Where to start?

**Our software is *exporting* IFC datasets. Where should I start?**

Please read through the sprint documentation [here](https://github.com/bSI-InfraRoom/IFC-Tunnel-Deployment/tree/main/sprints). We recommend going from top to bottom and implement exporting functionality as indicated by *Usages* section in each sprint documentation.

When happy with the export, you are welcome to open a pull request and get your file automatically checked as well as reviewed by the project team.

**Our software is *importing* IFC datasets. Where should I start?**

Please use any (preferably all) of the files provided [here](https://github.com/bSI-InfraRoom/IFC-Tunnel-Deployment/tree/main/files). 

Please denote successful import by providing a screen shot in the same folder as the originating dataset resides. Other kind of proof is welcome as well.

We recommend starting/appending to a readme named after your software in each directory. You are free in the structure of the readme (as of now).

## Review

**The check is not running.**

If this is your first pull request with this repository, we (the project team) need to *manually* start the checking procedure (it's a GitHub *feature*). Please remain patient until we merge the first pull request. 

After a successful merge the checker will run automatically, not needing our intervention anymore.

**The check of my Pull request is failing. Where is the report?**

**I get the following message in review**

- *lftm*

Looks fine to me. This means the reviewer did not spot any obvious mistakes.

- *The file has a lot more content than required - this approval only covers the concepts as part of Sprint x.y and its prerequisites. It may be that the file will fail future checks and will need amendment.*

The file exceeds the requirements from Sprint x.y. While the submitted file has been approved, this does not constitute any approval for content outside the Sprint x.y's (and its prerequisites') scope.
